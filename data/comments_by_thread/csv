If they drop there's nothing to do but trade everyone and just bottom feed.

And he is the main reason why I am watching this game. He had a lot of these games. 4th option in offense. Hits open threes. And when he does, he always had a good game. But we know the moment the scouting catch up on him. He disappears.


I am just monitoring the good games he is stringing. So far two now which is good. But very limited role on offense.


The problem with Patrick is he was drafted 4th overall and the expectation is high. But he hasn't developed into that shot creator everyone expected of a high pick.


Right now we can just hope he can fill the role of Andrew Wiggins in GSW.


Wiggins was 4th option behind Steph, Klay and Dray. And he was #1 overall pick. Wiggins molded himself into a good rebounding forward. And strong defender. From being a go to guy in offense.


I think that is a more realistic role for Patrick."

It's a bit harder to see exactly how Coby's return to a starting role would be as helpful...and that makes me a little sad to admit.

I like the way playing big helps Matas, and I like Okoro's activity and PoA defense. You have to sacrifice at least one of those if Coby is your starting 2.

Whenever he returns, there's gonna be a lot of pressure on Coby to show if that sacrifice is worth it for this roster."

I was in this in Coby's entire career. But the COby, GIddey and Collins injuries happening at the same time. And their expected recovery coincide the January 15, 2026 lifting of trade restrictions for the like of Kuminga. Kuminga who is expected to be the main domino piece that would trigger a league wide trade bonanza. 


For the first time now, I am entertaining of trading Coby.


Quentin Grimes who is around the same age as Coby and Ayo. Didn't get to extend with Philly and is an UFA next off-season.


Quentin Grimes is a 3&D guard with developing playmaking skills. The type of guard who fits with Matas and Giddey(if he is not traded). Grimes is also expected to be cheaper than Coby. Coby is likely eyeing at least $30M annually. Grimes originally asked for the same amount of money. But lowered his asking price to 20-25M.


I would see what the Bulls can fetch out of Coby. And explore free agency with bigger cap space for the likes of Grimes."

We have a great bench and even missing are starting backcourt+Ayo playing on 2 sprained thumbs were 2-0.   Vs a decent Orlando team and a Pels team that has owned us recently, even if their record isn’t good their size usually gives us fits.


I defend Billy more than most but I feel likes he’s a little to blame for that stretch. Obviously it’s up to the players to lock in but mins distribution can be questionable, and some of the lineups can be a bit puzzling until he calls a TO a couple possessions late so he can fix it.

*for example his reluctance to play Matas at the 3 and Smith at the 4. Though I appreciate he’s done more of that recently I’ve been(and others) wanting that since last season."

Matas has enough good plays but he’ll still get pulled at moments because of keeping him fresh/foul trouble. 

I think my problem with Bill kinda boils down to his lineups and usage of Matas and Smith. Like 99% of Bulls fans probably think Matas is a better fit at the 3 than 4. Smith can play the 4 when Vuc is out there, and Vuc hasn’t been terrible at the 4 when Collins is out there. Smith/Collins has played well together recently too. Obviously all 3 of our bigs have gone through some injury at some point on that stretch, but he was still allergic to going double big for a period despite Smith giving a lot of good minutes. Even if he bricked too many 3s tonight."

But this is a classic Bulls vs Magic game. Where both teams trade bricks trying to shoot themselves out of cold stretches. It has always been like that whenever these teams face off against each other.


The positive of not having someone to monopolize the ball. Is the ball hops. And once again, the scoring is spread out. Also that Vooch as the top offensive talent. Vooch doesn't out shoot himself. And always move the ball to open teammates.


Though Vooch having a good game is a match-up dependent. But this game, Oatmeal is smaller and not that athletic to cover Vooch. So Vooch as a go to guy works in droughts this game.


But seeing how the rest of these affordable contracts can compete against an east playoff team like Orlando. It gives me hope that we can move the expensive starters for better players. Because the cheaper bench has been holding on their own. More than that starters for most of the games now."

Losing Giddey was huge but with the starters already sucking no Giddey and Coby allowed the team to have some defense out there and no Coby meant there was team ball.

Of course as per usual the team won from the bench getting hot. But the starting unit being able to

First - not have the terrible 4-5 defensive punch of Buzelis and Vuc, put Smith in there at the 4

Second - have a guy in Tre who can play passable ball handler/point guard defense and still be better than Coby or Giddey guarding 2s if Okoro is on the 1.

Third, allow Buzelis to take the weak wing matchup for once and also let him help more

Fourth, have the option to counter 2 big or non threat PF lineups by having Jalen on the pick and roll big and Vuc out of the paint ready to help on the rebound

I think Coby is a slight net negative in the starting lineup and Coby + Giddey ruins the perimeter defense so with Giddey he is a bigger net negative.

I hope Billy realises you can't play 4 of Vuc, Matas, Coby, Giddey on defense and you need a 4 and a point guard on defense in that lineup, so it has to be Coby to go for a 4, where okoro guards the point, or a point guard, where Okoro takes the best wing. Still don't like Matas and Giddey at the forward slots on defense though, ideally you trade Coby and get a 2/3 who can play 1-3 on defense and shoot okay, or put Ayo in there as a stop gap. Ayo might not be a great defender but he can slot in in a few places and him and Okoro might allow Giddey and Matas to slot in on the right guys"

Hureter for a “shooter” has had an awful year and will be playing on a vet minimum contract next season. Phillips and Terry shouldn’t be in the NBA. Some of the least offensively skilled players in the NBA. Their shots even look awful just leaving the hand.

Everyone looked shook and quiet and suddenly they couldn't hit *anything.* It's one thing to clank 3s, but these guys were getting easy lay-ups and missing. It was like the hoop was bent. 

People in the game thread were bitching about lineups, but nothing was working. No one could score and the refs were really one-sided. This wasn't a lineup issue beyond the fact that no one played well. This sort of shit happens I guess, it's really hard to win when you're down 4 key rotational players. The Bulls did what they were supposed, they played in the post, but it didn't matter because they couldn't hit a shot to save their lives.

Also as a PS Vooch, the more you complain about guys scoring in the end the more they're going to do it unless you give them a real reason to stop. You had the ball as LeMelo was coming up the court. If you're mad, either whip it baseball style at him full speed and see if what happens or just move on. Waiting for the game to end to call him an ass does nothing. He knows he's an ass, he likes pissing you off, it's going to be something they spend all night laughing about in the locker room. For fuck sakes one of their key players beats his wife and kids, you think they're going to care about an unwritten rule? Either shit or get off the pot."

Bad man Lavine was holding Giddey back when everything couldn’t be catered to Giddey. Now will Bulls fans eventually see the Giddler as holding Matas back? Time will tell!

Buzelis has a short leash with Donovan and Giddey has had the same role the entire time, he’s just been getting better as he’s gotten more comfortable in it

I swear you guys are only able to think in ESPN narratives. Sometimes guys just play better than at other times"

Lots of fans absolutely blamed Lavine for the team’s and Giddey’s struggles.

I'm not too bothered by the game but we can't have slow starts like that or give up so many rebounds.. hopefully a point of emphasis going forward."

Also had words for a fan or something after one of them. His play was aggressive, but I felt his overall demeanor was different as well. I'm sure being down big and getting kind of embarrassed plays a big role, as it should. All good signs imo, hoping this is a turning point kind of game that we see another leap from him."

Like he smiles after dunks when we're not playing like doodoo etc. 

But yeah, good signs, just needs to keep building muscle for the future."
